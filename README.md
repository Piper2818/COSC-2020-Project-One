# COSC-2020-Project-One
First assignment in Computer Science II

The goal of this project is to read in two files word by word, clean each word ( AKA take out any ',., or spaces), then store the words in using linked lists. The first file is a dictionary and the second file is a book. Once both files have been read and stored we want to count how many words in the book are misspelled, how many words are in the book total, and also keep track of how long it takes the code to run.
